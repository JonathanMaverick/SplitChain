Extract structured info from this receipt image and return JSON only in this format:

{
  "storeName": string,
  "billDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "items": [
    {
      "name": string,
      "quantity": int,
      "price": float
    }
  ],
  "tax": float,
  "service": float
}

- All monetary values (price, tax, and service) must be returned in USD format as floating point numbers (e.g., 19.99).
- If a price ends with ".00", you can include the decimal part.
- Only respond with JSON. Use `null` for any missing or unclear values.
- If there is unit price and total, pick the total instead of unit price
